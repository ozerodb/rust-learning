# Random stuff

This folder will contain random codes written in Rust. Not necessarily related to learning Rust, but just random stuff I want to try out.

**Note:** the aim in these codes is to try out crates and understand Rust patterns, they are not full-blown project and sometimes don't even include error-handling.
